Health Insurance Charges Prediction
Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting health insurance charges based on various demographic and health-related features. The project utilizes a linear regression model to analyze the relationship between the input features and the target variable, which is the insurance charges.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is derived from a health insurance dataset that includes the following features:

-age: Age of the insured individual
-sex: Gender of the insured individual (male/female)
-bmi: Body Mass Index of the insured individual
-children: Number of children/dependents covered by the insurance
-smoker: Whether the insured individual is a smoker (yes/no)
-region: The region where the insured individual resides (northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest)
-charges: The medical charges incurred by the insured individual (target variable)


Methodology
-Data Preparation: The dataset is loaded and preprocessed to separate the features (X) from the target variable (y). The target variable is 'charges', while the remaining columns serve as features.
-Train-Test Split: The dataset is split into training and testing sets using an 80-20 split. This allows for model training on one subset of the data while evaluating its performance on a separate subset.
-Model Training: A linear regression model from the sklearn library is instantiated and trained on the training dataset.
-Prediction: The trained model is used to predict insurance charges on the test dataset.
-Results: The predictions are displayed alongside the actual features for a sample of test cases.


Results
The following table presents a sample of the predictions made by the model:

Age	Sex	BMI	Children	Smoker	Region	Predicted Charges
18	female	24.09	1	no	southeast	5271.20
39	male	26.41	0	yes	northeast	31226.48
27	male	29.15	0	yes	southeast	30074.96
71	male	65.50	13	yes	southeast	45354.15
28	male	38.06	0	no	southeast	7015.99



Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of linear regression for predicting health insurance charges based on various factors. The model can be further improved by exploring more complex algorithms, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning.
